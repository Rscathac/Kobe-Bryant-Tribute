Still can't believe what just happened today. Prayers to his family and all the families affected. 

Growing up a diehard Lakers fan, Idolizing you as a hero, I still still can remember every moment you played on the court. The playoffs against the Suns, Celtics, Magics. Every single moment with D.Fish,  Lamar, Pau. Every clutch shot you took. The moment You raised the trophy. The game against the Warriors. The last game against the Utah. Man, everything was just like yesterday.

Everything will never be the same...

Really appreciate for what you've devoted to and what you've done for the entire basketball world.

Your mentality and Your legacy will live on forever.

May you rest in Peace Kobe and little angle Gigi.
